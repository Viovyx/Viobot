# Viobot
Very basic Discord bot created with Python.

Now has databases in json format for easy access that are used for logs and birthdays!

### Current command list:
- `/ping`
- `/quote`
- `/bday-set`
- `/bday-show`

## How to set up?
Make sure to have python3 installed and install the `requirements.txt` packages.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project containing the following:
```dotenv
TOKEN='<YOUR BOTS TOKEN>'
BDAY_CHANNEL_ID='<THE CHANNEL-ID FOR BDAY MESSAGES>'
```
Make sure to replace the parameters inside `<...>` with your own parameters!
